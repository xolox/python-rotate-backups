Usage: rotate-backups [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY, ..]

Easy rotation of backups based on the Python package by the same name.

To use this program you specify a rotation scheme via (a combination of) the
--hourly, --daily, --weekly, --monthly and/or --yearly options and the
directory (or directories) containing backups to rotate as one or more
positional arguments.

You can rotate backups on a remote system over SSH by prefixing a DIRECTORY
with an SSH alias and separating the two with a colon (similar to how rsync
accepts remote locations).

Instead of specifying directories and a rotation scheme on the command line you
can also add them to a configuration file. For more details refer to the online
documentation (see also the --config option).

Please use the --dry-run option to test the effect of the specified rotation
scheme before letting this program loose on your precious backups! If you don't
test the results using the dry run mode and this program eats more backups than
intended you have no right to complain ;-).

Supported options:

  -M, --minutely=COUNT

    In a literal sense this option sets the number of "backups per minute" to
    preserve during rotation. For most use cases that doesn't make a lot of
    sense :-) but you can combine the --minutely and --relaxed options to
    preserve more than one backup per hour.  Refer to the usage of the -H,
    --hourly option for details about COUNT.

  -H, --hourly=COUNT

    Set the number of hourly backups to preserve during rotation:

    - If COUNT is a number it gives the number of hourly backups to preserve,
      starting from the most recent hourly backup and counting back in time.
    - Alternatively you can provide an expression that will be evaluated to get
      a number (e.g. if COUNT is `7 * 2' the result would be 14).
    - You can also pass `always' for COUNT, in this case all hourly backups are
      preserved.
    - By default no hourly backups are preserved.

  -d, --daily=COUNT

    Set the number of daily backups to preserve during rotation. Refer to the
    usage of the -H, --hourly option for details about COUNT.

  -w, --weekly=COUNT

    Set the number of weekly backups to preserve during rotation. Refer to the
    usage of the -H, --hourly option for details about COUNT.

  -m, --monthly=COUNT

    Set the number of monthly backups to preserve during rotation. Refer to the
    usage of the -H, --hourly option for details about COUNT.

  -y, --yearly=COUNT

    Set the number of yearly backups to preserve during rotation. Refer to the
    usage of the -H, --hourly option for details about COUNT.

  -t, --timestamp-pattern=PATTERN

    Customize the regular expression pattern that is used to match and extract
    timestamps from filenames. PATTERN is expected to be a Python compatible
    regular expression that must define the named capture groups 'year',
    'month' and 'day' and may define 'hour', 'minute' and 'second'.

  -I, --include=PATTERN

    Only process backups that match the shell pattern given by PATTERN. This
    argument can be repeated. Make sure to quote PATTERN so the shell doesn't
    expand the pattern before it's received by rotate-backups.

  -x, --exclude=PATTERN

    Don't process backups that match the shell pattern given by PATTERN. This
    argument can be repeated. Make sure to quote PATTERN so the shell doesn't
    expand the pattern before it's received by rotate-backups.

  -j, --parallel

    Remove backups in parallel, one backup per mount point at a time. The idea
    behind this approach is that parallel rotation is most useful when the
    files to be removed are on different disks and so multiple devices can be
    utilized at the same time.

    Because mount points are per system the -j, --parallel option will also
    parallelize over backups located on multiple remote systems.

  -p, --prefer-recent

    By default the first (oldest) backup in each time slot is preserved. If
    you'd prefer to keep the most recent backup in each time slot instead then
    this option is for you.

  -r, --relaxed

    By default the time window for each rotation scheme is enforced (this is
    referred to as strict rotation) but the -r, --relaxed option can be used
    to alter this behavior. The easiest way to explain the difference between
    strict and relaxed rotation is using an example:

    - When using strict rotation and the number of hourly backups to preserve
      is three, only backups created in the relevant time window (the hour of
      the most recent backup and the two hours leading up to that) will match
      the hourly frequency.

    - When using relaxed rotation the three most recent backups will all match
      the hourly frequency (and thus be preserved), regardless of the
      calculated time window.

    If the explanation above is not clear enough, here's a simple way to decide
    whether you want to customize this behavior or not:

    - If your backups are created at regular intervals and you never miss an
      interval then strict rotation (the default) is probably the best choice.

    - If your backups are created at irregular intervals then you may want to
      use the -r, --relaxed option in order to preserve more backups.

  -i, --ionice=CLASS

    Use the `ionice' program to set the I/O scheduling class and priority of
    the `rm' invocations used to remove backups. CLASS is expected to be one of
    the values `idle' (3), `best-effort' (2) or `realtime' (1). Refer to the
    man page of the `ionice' program for details about these values. The
    numeric values are required by the 'busybox' implementation of 'ionice'.

  -c, --config=FILENAME

    Load configuration from FILENAME. If this option isn't given the following
    default locations are searched for configuration files:

    - /etc/rotate-backups.ini and /etc/rotate-backups.d/*.ini
    - ~/.rotate-backups.ini and ~/.rotate-backups.d/*.ini
    - ~/.config/rotate-backups.ini and ~/.config/rotate-backups.d/*.ini

    Any available configuration files are loaded in the order given above, so
    that sections in user-specific configuration files override sections by the
    same name in system-wide configuration files. For more details refer to the
    online documentation.

  -C, --removal-command=CMD

    Change the command used to remove backups. The value of CMD defaults to
    ``rm -fR``. This choice was made because it works regardless of whether
    "backups to be rotated" are files or directories or a mixture of both.

    As an example of why you might want to change this, CephFS snapshots are
    represented as regular directory trees that can be deleted at once with a
    single 'rmdir' command (even though according to POSIX semantics this
    command should refuse to remove nonempty directories, but I digress).

  -u, --use-sudo

    Enable the use of `sudo' to rotate backups in directories that are not
    readable and/or writable for the current user (or the user logged in to a
    remote system over SSH).

  -s, --stat-timestamp

    Use mtime stat timestamps, instead of filenames, to determine the
    date of each file.

  -S, --syslog=CHOICE

    Explicitly enable or disable system logging instead of letting the program
    figure out what to do. The values '1', 'yes', 'true' and 'on' enable system
    logging whereas the values '0', 'no', 'false' and 'off' disable it.

  -f, --force

    If a sanity check fails an error is reported and the program aborts. You
    can use --force to continue with backup rotation instead. Sanity checks
    are done to ensure that the given DIRECTORY exists, is readable and is
    writable. If the --removal-command option is given then the last sanity
    check (that the given location is writable) is skipped (because custom
    removal commands imply custom semantics).

  -n, --dry-run

    Don't make any changes, just print what would be done. This makes it easy
    to evaluate the impact of a rotation scheme without losing any backups.

  -v, --verbose

    Increase logging verbosity (can be repeated).

  -q, --quiet

    Decrease logging verbosity (can be repeated).

  -h, --help

    Show this message and exit.
