                                - An integer gives the number of backups in the
                                  corresponding category to preserve, starting from
                                  the most recent backup and counting back in
                                  time.
                                - The string 'always' means all backups in the

                                  the biggest time unit in the rotation scheme).

                                By default no backups are preserved for categories
                                (keys) not present in the dictionary.
        :param include_list: A list of strings with :mod:`fnmatch` patterns. If a
                             nonempty include list is specified each backup must
                             match a pattern in the include list, otherwise it
                             will be ignored.
        :param exclude_list: A list of strings with :mod:`fnmatch` patterns. If a
                             backup matches the exclude list it will be ignored,
                             *even if it also matched the include list* (it's the
                             only logical way to combine both lists).
        :param dry_run: If this is :data:`True` then no changes will be made, which
                        provides a 'preview' of the effect of the rotation scheme
                        (the default is :data:`False`). Right now this is only useful
                        in the command line interface because there's no return
                        value.
        :param io_scheduling_class: Use ``ionice`` to set the I/O scheduling class
                                    (expected to be one of the strings 'idle',
                                    'best-effort' or 'realtime').
        :param config_file: The pathname of a configuration file (a string).
        :param strict: Whether to enforce the time window for each rotation
                       frequency (a boolean, defaults to :data:`True`). The
                       easiest way to explain the difference between strict
                       and relaxed rotation is using an example:

                       - If `strict` is :data:`True` and the number of hourly
                         backups to preserve is three, only backups created in
                         the relevant time window (the hour of the most recent
                         backup and the two hours leading up to that) will
                         match the hourly frequency.

                       - If `strict` is :data:`False` then the three most
                         recent backups will all match the hourly frequency
                         (and thus be preserved), regardless of the calculated
                         time window.

                       If the explanation above is not clear enough, here's a
                       simple way to decide whether you want to customize this
                       behavior:

                       - If your backups are created at regular intervals and
                         you never miss an interval then the default
                         (:data:`True`) is most likely fine.

                       - If your backups are created at irregular intervals
                         then you may want to set `strict` to :data:`False` to
                         convince :class:`RotateBackups` to preserve more
                         backups.
