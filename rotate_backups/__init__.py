        Whether to enforce the time window for each rotation frequency (a boolean, defaults to :data:`True`).

        The easiest way to explain the difference between strict and relaxed
        rotation is using an example:

        - If :attr:`strict` is :data:`True` and the number of hourly backups to
          preserve is three, only backups created in the relevant time window
          (the hour of the most recent backup and the two hours leading up to
          that) will match the hourly frequency.

        - If :attr:`strict` is :data:`False` then the three most recent backups
          will all match the hourly frequency (and thus be preserved),
          regardless of the calculated time window.

        If the explanation above is not clear enough, here's a simple way to
        decide whether you want to customize this behavior:

        - If your backups are created at regular intervals and you never miss
          an interval then the default (:data:`True`) is most likely fine.

        - If your backups are created at irregular intervals then you may want
          to set :attr:`strict` to :data:`False` to convince
          :class:`RotateBackups` to preserve more backups.
